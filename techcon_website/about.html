            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a grassroots initiative by a small group of passionate technologists who envisioned a collaborative platform for sharing cutting-edge ideas. Held initially in a modest community hall, the first conference focused primarily on open-source technologies and community-driven development.</p>
            <p>Over the years, TechCon rapidly expanded its scope and reach, attracting participants and speakers from around the globe. By 2015, it had become a prominent event in the tech calendar, recognized for its forward-thinking discussions on AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, and sustainable tech. Each annual conference has built upon the last, fostering a legacy of innovation and knowledge exchange.</p>
